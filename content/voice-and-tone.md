## Important Principles
Here's a few key takeaways:

* **Events:** Each time you mention an event, double check the date and time is mentioned and consistent with the main calendar.
* **Links:** Never write "Click here". Read more about <a href="/voice-and-tone/04-writing-online">writing online</a>

## What is Voice and Tone
One way we write empowering content is by being aware of our voice and our tone. This section explains the difference between voice and tone, and lays out the elements of each as they apply to Antioch.

**What’s the difference between voice and tone?** Think of it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use one tone when you're out to dinner with your closest friends, and a different tone when you're in a meeting with your boss.

Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t want to use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing.

The same is true for Antioch. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.

## Voice

At Antioch, we know theology is a minefield of confusing terminology. That’s why we speak like the experienced and compassionate partner we wish we’d had way back when. 

We treat every question and person seriously. We want to educate people without patronizing or confusing them. 

Using offbeat humor and a conversational voice, we play with language to bring joy to people. We prefer the subtle over the noisy, the wry over the farcical. We don't take ourselves too seriously.

Whether people have grown up in church don’t know the first thing about Christianity, every word we say informs and encourages. We impart our expertise with clarity, empathy, and wit.

### All of this means that when we write copy:

1. **We are plainspoken.** We understand the world Antioch is living in: one muddled by hyperbolic language, cherry-picked truths, and over-promises. We strip all that away and value clarity above all. We avoid distractions like fluffy metaphors and cheap plays to emotion. 

2. **We are genuine.** We get small businesses because we were one not too long ago. That means we relate to customers’ challenges and passions and speak to them in a familiar, warm, and accessible way. 

3. **We are translators.** Only experts can make what’s difficult look easy, and it’s our job to demystify theology and actually educate.

4. **Our humor is dry.** Our sense of humor is straight-faced, subtle, and a touch eccentric. We’re weird but not inappropriate, smart but not snobbish. We prefer winking to shouting. We’re never condescending or exclusive—we always bring our customers in on the joke.

## Tone

Antioch’s tone is a touch informal, but it’s always more important to be clear than entertaining. When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Are they searching for answers to a theological or doctrinal question? Are they confused about an event for their child? Once you have an idea of their emotional state, you can adjust your tone accordingly.

Antioch has a sense of humor that feels personable, so feel free to be funny when it’s appropriate and when it comes naturally to you. But don’t go out of your way to make a joke—forced humor can be worse than none at all. If you’re unsure, keep a straight face.
