We write the same way we operate a Sunday service: with a person-first perspective. Whether you’re writing for an internal or external audience, it's important to write for and about other people in a way that’s compassionate, inclusive, and respectful. Being aware of the impact of your language will help make Antioch a better place to serve and a better steward of our values in the world. In this section we'll lay out some guidelines for writing about people with compassion, and share some resources for further learning.

## Age

Don’t reference a person’s age unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. If it *is* relevant, include the person’s specific age, offset by commas.

<div class="box">
  <p><img src="../images/icons/no.svg" alt="Don't do this" class="icon" />The GC Student, 16, just got her driver’s license.</p>
</div>

Don’t refer to people using age-related descriptors like “young,” “old,” or “elderly.”

## Disability

Avoid disability-related idioms like “lame” or “falling on deaf ears.” Don’t refer to a person’s disability unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. If you need to mention it, ask whether your subject prefers person-first language (“they have a disability”) or identity-first language (“they are disabled”).

When writing about a person with disabilities, don’t use the words “suffer,” “victim,” or “handicapped.”
<div class="box">
  <p><img src="../images/icons/no.svg" alt="Don't do this" class="icon" />Handicapped parking is available.</p>
  <p><img src="../images/icons/yes.svg" alt="Do this" class="icon" />Accessible parking is available.</p>
</div>

## Gender and sexuality

Don’t call women “girls.” Don’t call groups of people “guys.”

Avoid gendered terms, unless it's relevant, in favor of neutral alternatives, like “server” instead of “waitress” and “businessperson” instead of “businessman.”

<div class="box">
  <p><img src="../images/icons/yes.svg" alt="Do this" class="icon" />Use the following words as modifiers, but <i>never</i> as nouns:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>lesbian</li>
    <li>gay</li>
    <li>bisexual</li>
    <li>transgender (never "transgendered")</li>
    <li>trans</li>
    <li>queer</li>
    <li>LGBT</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="box">
  <p><img src="../images/icons/no.svg" alt="Don't do this" class="icon" />Don’t use these words in reference to LGBT people or communities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>homosexual</li>
    <li>lifestyle</li>
    <li>preference</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Avoid “gay marriage.” If necessary, use same-sex marriage. Whenever possible, stick with “marriage.” Imagine a same-sex couple is considering visiting Antioch and reads what you're writing.

## Hearing

Use “deaf” as an adjective to describe a person with significant hearing loss. You can also use “partially deaf” or “hard of hearing.”

## Heritage and nationality

Don't use hyphens when referring to someone with dual heritage or nationality. For example, use "Asian American" instead of "Asian-American."

Use the term “undocumented immigrants” over “illegal immigrants”. Illegal is not a noun.

## Medical conditions

Don’t refer to a person’s medical condition unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing.

If a reference to a person’s medical condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities and emphasize the person first. Don’t call a person with a medical condition a “victim.”

## Mental and cognitive conditions

Don’t refer to a person’s mental or cognitive condition unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. Never assume that someone has a medical, mental, or cognitive condition.

Don’t describe a person as “mentally ill.” If a reference to a person’s mental or cognitive condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities or medical conditions and emphasize the person first.

<div class="box">
  <p><img src="../images/icons/no.svg" alt="Don't do this" class="icon" />A mentally ill child is welcome in services.</p>
  <p><img src="../images/icons/yes.svg" alt="Do this" class="icon" />Children with developmental disabilities are welcome.</p>
</div>

## Vision

Use the adjective “blind” to describe a person who is unable to see. Use “low vision” to describe a person with limited vision.
