## Installing the fonts

Installation is quite simple.

### On Mac

Double-click the font(s) in the Finder (you can select all at once), then click Install Font in the font preview window that opens. After your Mac validates the font and opens the Font Book app, the font is installed and available for use.

### On PC (Windows 10)

Click in Windows 10's new Search field (located just to the right of the Start button), type "fonts," then click the item that appears at the top of the results: Fonts - Control panel.
Then, simply drag any TrueType font file to the main window containing all your other installed fonts. (See screenshot at top.) When you drop it, you'll see a brief "installing font" message, and then, presto, you're done.
