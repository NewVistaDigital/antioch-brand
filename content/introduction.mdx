## About Arch

Arch provides a set of brand elements, patterns, and practices that work as the foundation for Antioch Church print materials, digital products, and experiences.

The goal of Arch is to improve design consistency and quality. Arch also helps to establish a common vocabulary between everyone in Ministry Crew.

## Accessibility

Arch comes accessibility baked in and provides support for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank">W3C’s WCAG 2.1 specifications</a>. We make sure all our components support touch screens, keyboard navigation, screen readers, and more.

## Brand Values

Everything at Antioch Church starts with values.

These brand values make their way into everything we do, design, write, code and otherwise create. They’re what make us ... us. And they’re what we hope people will feel when they interact with the brand.

## Our Mission

As a kingdom community we awaken, equip, and send people to transform cities, regions, and nations of the earth.

## Antioch Creed

We are a family of maturing sons and daughters, alive and victorious in the Spirit, culturally involved, globally connected, and generationally invested. We are passionately devoted to Jesus, incarnating His truth and advancing His kingdom.

## Our Pillars

**Awaken.** To lead people into an ongoing revelation of the Gospel understanding of who God is, who I am, who WE are, and what WE are doing.

**Equip.**To provide ongoing opportunities and resources that empower people to mature into their identity and develop skills for kingdom-oriented living.

**Send.**To commission the Church to incarnate God’s faithful presence in the world and partner with His work in the places they inhabit.
